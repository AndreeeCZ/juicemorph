JuiceMorph ladspa effect plugin
============================

OVERVIEW

My first real shot for a usable and final, yet very simple ladspa plugin.

It lets you record a short loop and then loop it. After each loop, based on propability,
some of the chunks get switched and some of them reversed.



COMPILATION/INSTALLATION;


typing make should build it if you have the LADSPA SDK installed.


"make install" will copy the .so to /usr/lib/ladspa
